This is a Web API project I made to better understand how to make one.

Things that I understood while creating this project:
- How to create Controllers
- How Repositories work
- How to use Entity Framework (Migrations, DbContext, ModelBuilder, DbSet)
- How Dtos work
- How Services work
- How to use AutoMapper
- How to use Swagger
- How to use Authentication and Authorization with JWT Tokens (creating password salt and hash)
